# opaque.accounting

Differential privacy accounting using Privacy Loss Distributions (PLD).

This module provides a compositional API for tracking privacy guarantees.
Mechanism constructors return `DpProcess` objects that compose with `*` (repeat)
and `|` (heterogeneous compose). Privacy metrics are queried directly on the
resulting process.

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc

step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8), sample_rate=0.01)
training = step * 1000
epsilon = training.epsilon_at(1e-5)
```

The underlying implementation uses Google's PLD accounting via the
`opaque-accounting` Rust crate (PyO3 bindings).

Published `opaque-accounting` artifacts are an sdist, `manylinux_2_28`
Linux wheels for `x86_64` and `aarch64`, and a macOS 11+ `arm64` wheel.
Windows, macOS `x86_64`, and `musllinux` wheels are intentionally not
published at the moment.

**See also**: [Privacy Accounting User Guide](../user-guide/accounting.md)

---

## Namespace organization

The accounting API is split into three namespaces:

| Namespace | Contents | Import |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `opaque.accounting` | Cross-cutting: calibration, composition, `Accountant`, `repeat`, `compose` | `import opaque.accounting as acc` |
| `opaque.dpsgd.accounting` | DP-SGD mechanisms: `gaussian`, `adaclip`, `poisson` (plain or truncated via `truncated_batch_size` / `dataset_size`), `parallel_poisson`, `k_out_of_t` | `from opaque.dpsgd import accounting as dpsgd_acc` |
| `opaque.dpftrl.accounting` | DP-FTRL mechanisms: `band_mf`, `blt`, `bisr`, `bsr`, `lambda_cgd`, `identity_mf`, `poisson` (cyclic when `bands > 1`, plain when `bands == 1`, parameterized by `n_steps`), `b_min_sep`, `balls_in_bins` | `from opaque.dpftrl import accounting as dpftrl_acc` |

The mechanism factories (`gaussian`, `poisson`, `band_mf`, …) live **only** on
the algorithm-scoped namespaces — use the namespace that matches your training
run. Cross-cutting primitives (`Accountant`, `calibrate`, `epsilon_budget`,
composition operators) live on `opaque.accounting`.

```python
# DP-SGD
from opaque.dpsgd import accounting as dpsgd_acc
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8), sample_rate=0.01)

# DP-FTRL
from opaque.dpftrl import accounting as dpftrl_acc
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import band_mf_strategy
strategy = band_mf_strategy(bands=10)
proc = dpftrl_acc.poisson(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    sample_rate=0.01,
    n_steps=1000,
)

# Cross-cutting composition and calibration always go via opaque.accounting
import opaque.accounting as acc
total = step * 1000
eps = total.epsilon_at(1e-5)
```

`opaque.dpsgd.accounting` and `opaque.dpftrl.accounting` are lazily imported:
the Rust PLD extension is not loaded until you access these submodules.

---

## Classes

### Custom budget checkpointing

`Accountant` checkpoints include an optional budget. The built-in budget
factories are registered automatically. If an application supplies its own
`Budget` protocol implementation, register a self-contained codec before
checkpointing:

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc

acc.register_budget_serializer(
    MyBudget,
    lambda budget: {"target": budget.target},
    lambda state: MyBudget(state["target"]),
)
```

The serializer must return JSON-compatible state and the deserializer must
rebuild the budget from that state. Checkpointing an unregistered budget or
restoring an unknown budget checkpoint type raises `CheckpointError`.

### `DpProcess`

Abstract base class for all privacy processes. Subclasses implement `pld()` to
compute the Privacy Loss Distribution on demand. Results are automatically
cached via `@lru_cache` (maxsize=8). Use `cached()` for larger cache
size (16) or as an opaque merge barrier.

**Privacy metrics:**

| Method               | Returns                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `epsilon_at(delta)`  | Smallest epsilon achieving (epsilon, delta)-DP   |
| `delta_at(epsilon)`  | Smallest delta achieving (epsilon, delta)-DP     |
| `advantage()`        | Total-variation advantage (f-DP)                 |
| `beta_at(alpha)`     | Type-II error at given Type-I error alpha        |
| `risk_at(prior)`     | Bayes risk under optimal adversary               |

Monte Carlo-backed `Pld` objects expose `mc_failure_probability`,
`mc_confidence`, and `mc_resolution`; analytic PLDs report zero failure and
zero MC resolution. The confidence construction certifies hockey-stick metrics
(`epsilon_at`, `delta_at`, and `advantage`). `beta_at` and `risk_at` fail
closed to zero for Monte Carlo PLDs because separate directional CDF bounds do
not by themselves certify a hypothesis-testing trade-off curve.

**Composition operators:**

| Operator     | Description                                  | Equivalent             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `proc * k`   | Homogeneous k-fold composition (repeat)      | `acc.repeat(proc, k)`  |
| `k * proc`   | Same (reflected multiply)                    | `acc.repeat(proc, k)`  |
| `a \| b`     | Heterogeneous composition                    | `acc.compose(a, b)`    |

Composition is optimized at construction time: identical steps are collapsed
via structural equality, nested repeats are flattened, and identity processes
are elided. Composing the same step in a loop produces a single `Repeated` node
with one `self_compose` call (2 FFTs), not `n` heterogeneous composes.

```python
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01)

# Homogeneous composition
training = step * 1000

# Heterogeneous composition (multi-phase)
phase1 = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01) * 500
phase2 = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.3), 0.01) * 500
total = phase1 | phase2

eps = total.epsilon_at(1e-5)
```

### `DiscretizationConfig`

Controls PLD discretization precision. Configuration is applied at **query time**
when computing privacy metrics via `pld()`, not stored in process structure.

| Parameter                      | Default      | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `discretization`               | `1e-4`       | Grid spacing for PLD PMF. Error scales as O(d^2) |
| `log_x_mass_truncation_bound`  | `-50`        | Tails below exp(bound) are truncated             |
| `max_grid_size`                | `10_000_000` | Coarsen grid if it exceeds this many bins        |
| `tail_mass_truncation`         | `1e-15`      | Tail-mass budget during composition              |
| `seed`                         | `42`         | RNG seed for Monte Carlo PLD builders            |
| `max_conv_grid`                | `32_768`     | Convolution grid cap for random-allocation PLD   |
| `mc_resolution`                | `1e-5`       | Maximum unresolved MC mass, in delta units       |
| `mc_failure_probability`       | `1e-6`       | Failure probability of the simultaneous MC bound |

The Monte Carlo count is derived from binary-KL Chernoff order-statistic bounds
with a Bonferroni allocation over all ranks and both adjacency directions. At
the default `mc_resolution=1e-5` and `mc_failure_probability=1e-6`, this
requires 2,940,252 samples per direction. Counts above 50 million emit an
advisory runtime warning but are not capped. The construction follows
[Hoeffding (1963)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.1963.10490085); the rank
and adjacency allocation makes the entire returned PLD simultaneous.
`epsilon_at(delta)` tightens the effective resolution to
`min(mc_resolution, delta / 2)`, reserving at least half of the requested delta
for finite privacy-loss mass.

Discretization is unconditionally conservative: exact atoms, PMF coarsening,
and histogram buckets are rounded upward. The API has no optimistic or
lower-bound mode.

**Query-time configuration (recommended):**

```python
# Create processes without config
proc = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8), 0.01)

# Apply config at query time
eps_coarse = proc.epsilon_at(1e-5, discretization=1e-3)  # faster, less accurate
eps_fine = proc.epsilon_at(1e-5, discretization=1e-5)    # slower, more accurate

# Monte Carlo accountants derive enough samples for the requested resolution.
pld = proc.pld(mc_resolution=1e-5, mc_failure_probability=1e-6, seed=123)
eps_mc = pld.epsilon_at(2e-5)
print(pld.mc_confidence, pld.mc_resolution)
```

All `pld()`-family methods (`epsilon_at`, `delta_at`, `advantage`, `beta_at`,
`risk_at`) accept every parameter in the table above except
`tail_mass_truncation` (composition-internal, module-level only). Overrides
are broadcast to every node of a composed process, so one `seed` is shared
by all Monte Carlo nodes — the same semantics as `set_discretization`.

**Module-level discretization defaults:**

Set default config for all queries when not overridden:

```python
acc.set_discretization(discretization=1e-4)  # Apply to all queries
proc = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8), 0.01)
eps = proc.epsilon_at(1e-5)  # Uses 1e-4 default
```

- `acc.set_discretization(discretization=1e-4, ...)` — Update the global
  default for only the named parameters; every omitted parameter keeps its
  current value. A bare call is a no-op.
- `acc.get_discretization()` — Return the current `DiscretizationConfig`

---

## Mechanism functions

All mechanism constructors return a `DpProcess`. Discretization is configured
at query time via `epsilon_at(..., discretization=...)` or module-level via
`set_discretization()`.

### `gaussian(noise_multiplier) -> DpProcess`

Gaussian mechanism with noise multiplier sigma. Adds noise N(0, sigma^2) to
sensitivity-1 queries. Base mechanism for DP-SGD.

- `noise_multiplier` (float): Ratio of noise std to sensitivity. Larger = more private.

### `poisson(inner, sample_rate) -> DpProcess`

Poisson-subsampled mechanism (standard DP-SGD step). `sample_rate` is
`batch_size / dataset_size`.

- `inner` (Gaussian | AdaClip): Base mechanism
- `sample_rate` (float): Probability of including each example, in (0, 1]

```python
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), sample_rate=256 / 50_000)
```

### `poisson(inner, sample_rate, *, truncated_batch_size=None, dataset_size=None) -> DpProcess` (truncated form)

`poisson()` switches to a truncated Poisson PLD when both
`truncated_batch_size` and `dataset_size` are set together (must be both
or neither). This is the truncated-Poisson PLD for capped batches; it does
**not** improve privacy versus plain Poisson at the same rate—use it when
training actually truncates draws.

- `inner` (Gaussian | AdaClip): Base mechanism
- `sample_rate` (float): Expected sampling rate, in (0, 1]
- `truncated_batch_size` (int | None): Optional max batch-size cap
- `dataset_size` (int | None): Required when `truncated_batch_size` is set

```python
n = 50_000
batch = 256
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(
    dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8),
    sample_rate=batch / n,
    truncated_batch_size=batch,
    dataset_size=n,
)
```

### `parallel_poisson(inner, sample_rate, num_workers) -> DpProcess`

Parallel Poisson subsampling. Models independent Poisson sampling on
multiple workers, where the same example can appear on multiple devices.
Like `poisson()` (plain or truncated), this is a full wrapper.

- `inner` (Gaussian | AdaClip): Base mechanism (from `gaussian()` or `adaclip()`)
- `sample_rate` (float): Probability of including each example, in (0, 1]
- `num_workers` (int): Number of parallel workers sampling independently

```python
step = dpsgd_acc.parallel_poisson(
    dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), sample_rate=0.01, num_workers=4,
)
```

### `k_out_of_t(inner, *, k, t, allocation) -> DpHorizonProcess`

With `allocation="block"`, every record participates in exactly one batch in
each of `k` contiguous, nearly equal blocks. Block sizes differ by at most one.

This mode pairs with
`opaque.dpsgd.sampling.KOutOfTSampler(..., allocation="block")` and
provides exact `pld_at(K)` prefix accounting. It is computed by the exact PLD
transform of Feldman & Shenfeld (2026), with no Monte Carlo sampling.

- `inner` (Gaussian | AdaClip | NonPrivate): Base mechanism
- `k` (int): Number of blocks / participations per record
- `t` (int): Total optimizer-step horizon
- `allocation` (`"block"` or `"total"`): Required allocation mode

```python
process = dpsgd_acc.k_out_of_t(
    dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5),
    k=num_epochs,
    t=num_epochs * steps_per_epoch,
    allocation="block",
)
eps = process.epsilon_at(1e-5)
```

With `allocation="total"`, every record chooses a uniform `k`-subset of the
complete horizon. The accountant currently uses the block reduction as a
conservative upper bound. For `k > 1`, partial-horizon queries return the
full-horizon bound.

### `adaclip(inner, *, fraction_noise_std, expected_batch_size, num_groups=1) -> DpProcess`

Accounts for the extra privacy cost of adaptive clipping's noisy
fraction query. Returns an `AdaClip` process composable with `poisson()`
(plain or truncated).

- `inner` (Gaussian): Base mechanism (from `gaussian()`)
- `fraction_noise_std` (float): Noise std on the clipping fraction. Default: 0.05.
- `expected_batch_size` (float): Expected batch size (`sample_rate × dataset_size`), used to compute the absolute noise std for the quantile query.
- `num_groups` (int): Number of independently adaptive clipping groups, and
  therefore independent noisy quantile queries. Default: 1. Set this to the
  number of groups when using per-group adaptive clipping.

```python
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.adaclip(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), fraction_noise_std=0.05, expected_batch_size=256), 0.01)
```

### Private second-moment release

When the noise mechanism produces both gradients **and** squared gradients
(via `clipped_grad(..., second_moment=True)`), the joint paired release uses
sensitivity-proportional Mahalanobis allocation in the runtime σ split (see
the [paired second-moment release](noise.md#paired-second-moment-release)
section). The Mahalanobis
budget collapses to a single sensitivity-1 Gaussian release at the same
noise multiplier, so **privacy accounting is exactly the underlying
first-moment mechanism**:

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc

# DP-SGD: same chain as first-moment-only
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.8), sample_rate=batch_size / dataset_size)
training = step * num_steps

# DP-FTRL with BandMF: same chain as first-moment-only
proc = dpftrl_acc.poisson(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    sample_rate=batch_size / dataset_size,
    n_steps=num_steps,
)
```

There is no separate `second_moment` transformation to wrap and no `ρ` knob:
the runtime σ on each stream already absorbs the joint cost. Use the
underlying mechanism factories (`dpsgd_acc.gaussian`, `dpftrl_acc.band_mf`,
…) directly.

### `eps_delta(epsilon, delta=0.0) -> DpProcess`

Fixed (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantee. Useful for composing an external mechanism
with known privacy parameters into tracked processes.

- `epsilon` (float): Privacy parameter (>= 0)
- `delta` (float): Failure probability (default 0.0)

```python
external = acc.eps_delta(3.0, 1e-5)
total = external | (dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01) * 1000)
```

### `identity() -> DpProcess`

Identity mechanism (zero privacy loss). Acts as the identity element in
composition: `identity() | a` returns `a`.

### `nonprivate() -> DpProcess`

Non-private mechanism (ε=∞, δ=0). Useful as a baseline or for training without
a privacy guarantee. All Poisson-family amplifications handle `nonprivate()`
inner transparently (zero privacy cost).

```python
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(acc.nonprivate(), sample_rate=0.01)
training = step * 1000
# training.epsilon_at(1e-5) == inf
```

---

## Matrix factorization mechanisms

MF mechanisms take pre-computed `sensitivity` and `gram_matrix` values from the
corresponding noise **strategy** (e.g. `band_mf_strategy()`, `blt_strategy()`).
The strategy is the single source of truth for these quantities — never hardcode
them. This keeps noise generation and accounting in sync.

All MF constructors return a `DpProcess` that composes with standard operators.

### `band_mf(noise_multiplier, sensitivity, coefficients) -> DpProcess`

BandMF mechanism for Poisson and b-min-sep amplification. Takes
`sensitivity` and `coefficients` from a `band_mf_strategy()`. The
band-width is `len(coefficients)`; `coefficients` must be non-empty.

- `noise_multiplier` (float): Raw noise standard deviation sigma.
- `sensitivity` (float): From `strategy.sensitivity(n_steps=...)`.
- `coefficients` (tuple of float values): From `strategy.coefficients`.

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import band_mf_strategy
strategy = band_mf_strategy(bands=10)
proc = dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy)
eps = proc.epsilon_at(1e-5)
```

### `blt(noise_multiplier, sensitivity, gram_matrix=()) -> DpProcess`

BLT (Buffered Linear Toeplitz) mechanism. Takes `sensitivity` and optional
`gram_matrix` from a `blt_strategy()`.

### Correlated MF mechanisms (BLT, λCGD, BISR, BSR)

Build via `dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(noise_multiplier, strategy)` — the strategy owns
sensitivity, Gram matrix, coefficients, min_sep, and max_participations:

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import blt_strategy
strategy = blt_strategy(max_buffers=10)

# Unamplified — single-Gaussian PLD
proc = dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy)

# With Balls-in-Bins amplification
proc = dpftrl_acc.balls_in_bins(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    num_bins=1000, n_steps=5000,
)
```

The same `as_mechanism` API works for `lambda_cgd_strategy`,
`bisr_strategy`, and `bsr_strategy`:

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import lambda_cgd_strategy
strategy = lambda_cgd_strategy(lambda_=0.9)
proc = dpftrl_acc.balls_in_bins(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    num_bins=steps_per_epoch, n_steps=steps_per_epoch * num_epochs,
)
```

### `poisson(inner, sample_rate, *, n_steps) -> DpProcess`

Poisson amplification for DP-FTRL. Whole-process accountant covering all
`n_steps` training rounds (do **not** compose with `* num_steps`
externally). Cyclic when the inner is `BandMf` with `bands > 1` (decomposes
into `ceil(n_steps / bands)` independent groups); plain Poisson per round
when the inner is `IdentityMf` or `BandMf` with `bands == 1`.

- `inner` (BandMf | IdentityMf): MF mechanism.
- `sample_rate` (float): Poisson sampling probability per round.
- `n_steps` (int, keyword-only): Total number of training rounds.

```python
strategy = band_mf_strategy(bands=10)
proc = dpftrl_acc.poisson(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    sample_rate=0.01,
    n_steps=1000,
)
```

### `b_min_sep(inner, *, n_steps, p0) -> DpProcess`

Warm-start **b-min-sep** amplification for BandMF (Dong & Ganesh, arXiv:2602.09338).
Uses Monte Carlo PLD accounting. `inner` must be
`mf_gaussian(nm, BandMfStrategy(...))` — strategy coefficients and band width
are read from `inner.strategy`. `p0` is the per-example participation rate per
iteration `E[|B|]/|D|` (match the training sampler’s target batch size).
Control the confidence construction per query with `mc_resolution`,
`mc_failure_probability`, and `seed`, or module-wide via `set_discretization`.
The sample count is derived automatically and exposed as
`get_discretization().resolved_num_mc_samples`.

!!! note "Monte Carlo confidence"
    b-min-sep, and Balls-in-Bins with a **correlated** strategy, build their
    PLDs from simultaneous one-sided order-statistic bounds over both adjacency
    directions. Unresolved probability is placed at `+∞`, so
    `epsilon_at(delta)` returns infinity when `delta` is at or below the
    reported `pld.infinity_mass`. `pld.mc_failure_probability` is statistical
    confidence metadata and is separate from mechanism delta.

### `balls_in_bins(inner, *, num_bins, n_steps) -> DpProcess`

Balls-in-Bins (random-partition) amplification. Returns the **total** privacy
cost across all epochs — do NOT compose further with `* num_epochs`.

With `identity_strategy()` (uncorrelated noise) the Gram is exactly
`num_epochs · I`, so the dominating pair collapses onto 1-out-of-`num_bins`
random allocation at `σ / √num_epochs` and the PLD is computed by the exact
transform — deterministic, no sampling. For correlated-noise strategies
(DP-λCGD, BISR, BSR, BLT) it uses Monte Carlo sampling of the dominating pair.

- `inner` (MfGaussian): `dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(nm, strategy)`.
- `num_bins` (int): Number of bins per epoch (typically `dataset_size / batch_size`).
- `n_steps` (int): Total training rounds; must be a multiple of `num_bins`.

```python
# With DP-λCGD
strategy = lambda_cgd_strategy(
    lambda_=0.9, n_steps=total_steps,
    min_sep=steps_per_epoch, max_participations=num_epochs,
)
proc = dpftrl_acc.balls_in_bins(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(1.0, strategy),
    num_bins=steps_per_epoch, n_steps=steps_per_epoch * num_epochs,
)
```

### `per_step(proc) -> PerStep`

Adapter that wraps a whole-horizon accountant so it composes step-by-step
under `Accountant`'s `acct |= step` idiom. `per_step(proc) * K` materialises
the process-aware K-prefix PLD via `proc.pld_at(K)`. Analytic mechanisms use a
strategy-aware prefix bound. For b-min-sep and correlated-strategy
Balls-in-Bins, every nonzero prefix conservatively charges the full-horizon
confidence-bounded PLD. This preserves monotonicity and boundedness but gives
up prefix tightness. Identity Balls-in-Bins retains its exact prefix path.
`K > proc.n_steps` raises.

- `proc` (DpHorizonProcess): The whole-process accountant
  (`dpftrl_acc.poisson(...)`, `b_min_sep(...)`, `balls_in_bins(...)`).

```python
proc = dpftrl_acc.poisson(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(0.8, strategy),
    sample_rate=0.01, n_steps=15_624,
)
step = acc.per_step(proc)
eps_K = (step * 1_000).epsilon_at(1e-5)   # analytic PLD: K-step ε ≤ proc.epsilon_at(δ)
```

---

## Composition Functions

Functional equivalents of the `*` and `|` operators. Most users should prefer
the operator syntax.

### `repeat(process, count) -> DpProcess`

Homogeneous k-fold composition. Equivalent to `process * count`.

### `compose(left, right) -> DpProcess`

Heterogeneous two-process composition. Equivalent to `left | right`.

### `cached(process) -> DpProcess`

Increases the LRU cache size from 8 to 16 entries and acts as an opaque merge
barrier: the composition optimizer will not look through a cached node.

**Note**: All `pld()` methods are automatically cached with `maxsize=8` via
`@lru_cache`. Use `cached()` when you need:
- A larger cache (16 entries instead of 8)
- An explicit merge barrier to prevent composition optimizations

```python
# All queries automatically cached (maxsize=8)
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01)
eps = step.epsilon_at(1e-5)   # Cached automatically
adv = step.advantage()         # Cache hit

# Use cached() for merge barrier or larger cache
training = acc.cached(step * 1000)
eps = training.epsilon_at(1e-5)   # Cached with maxsize=16
```

---

## Serialization

Processes checkpoint as a **flat** `dict[str, Any]` (string keys with dotted
prefixes for nested composition). Use `opaque.serialization.state_dict`
and `opaque.serialization.from_state_dict` — pass any concrete `DpProcess`
instance as the template (for example, `identity()`); the registered handler
rebuilds from the dict's root `type` field.

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc
from opaque.serialization import from_state_dict, state_dict
import opaque.dpsgd.accounting as dpsgd_acc

step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01)
flat = state_dict(step)
step2 = from_state_dict(acc.identity(), flat)
```

---

## Accountant

The `Accountant` class tracks accumulated privacy loss across a training loop.
It provides a functional API: composing a new process returns a fresh
`Accountant` (the original is not modified).

Merge optimization is automatic. Composing the same `step` repeatedly in a loop
produces a single `Repeated` node internally.

```python
from opaque.accounting import Accountant

acct = Accountant()
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01)

for i in range(num_steps):
    acct = acct | step

    if i % 100 == 0:
        eps = acct.epsilon_at(1e-5)
        print(f"Step {i}: eps={eps:.2f}")
```

### Budget tracking

Pass an optional `Budget` from the calibration module to enable budget checking:

```python
from opaque.accounting import calibration as cal
from opaque.accounting import Accountant

budget = cal.epsilon_budget(3.0, delta=1e-5)
acct = Accountant(budget=budget)
step = dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(0.5), 0.01)

for i in range(num_steps):
    acct = acct | step
    if acct.budget_exceeded:
        print("Privacy budget exhausted.")

### Seeding with a prior process

Pass `prefix` to start from an already-executed process instead of the
zero-cost identity. This is sequential composition across runs: use it when a
second training stage (e.g. DPO after SFT) touches the same dataset, so the
new run's budget checks and reported ε include the earlier run's cost. The
prefix composes at the PLD level — much tighter than adding the two stages'
epsilons.

```python
import json

from opaque.accounting import Accountant
from opaque.serialization import from_state_dict

with open("sft_checkpoint/accountant.json") as f:
    sft = from_state_dict(Accountant(), json.load(f))

acct = Accountant(budget=budget, prefix=sft.process)
acct = acct | dpo_step  # composes on top of the SFT prefix
```

If the two stages train on disjoint records (and the privacy unit is the
record), no prefix is needed — parallel composition applies and the overall
guarantee is the pointwise max of the two stages' ε(δ) curves.

### Serialization

```python
from opaque.accounting import Accountant
from opaque.serialization import from_state_dict, state_dict

flat = state_dict(acct)
acct2 = from_state_dict(Accountant(), flat)
```

`process.*` keys hold the composed tree; `budget.*` keys are present when
the accountant was constructed with a budget.

## Calibration

Submodule: `opaque.accounting.calibration`

```python
from opaque.accounting import calibration as cal
```

Binary search for finding parameter values that achieve a target privacy budget.

### `calibrate(budget, process, param_min, param_max, tolerance=1e-6, max_iterations=100, prefix=None) -> CalibrateResult`

Binary search for a parameter value such that `process(param)` produces a
`DpProcess` achieving the given privacy budget from the privacy-safe side.

| Parameter        | Default | Description                                              |
|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `budget`         |         | A `Budget` object from a budget factory (see below)      |
| `process`        |         | Callable: `float -> DpProcess`                           |
| `param_min`      |         | Lower bound for search                                   |
| `param_max`      |         | Upper bound for search                                   |
| `tolerance`      | `1e-6`  | Positive, finite relative convergence tolerance          |
| `max_iterations` | `100`   | Positive maximum number of binary search iterations      |
| `prefix`         | `None`  | Already-executed `DpProcess` composed into every probe   |

The `process` callable takes a single float parameter and returns a `DpProcess`.
Its metric must be monotone in the parameter over `[param_min, param_max]`;
the search direction is derived automatically by probing both endpoints, so
noise-multiplier-like parameters (increase improves privacy) and
sample-rate/step-like parameters (increase spends privacy) are both
supported. Exactly one endpoint must be privacy-safe; which one is detected,
not positional.

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc
from opaque.accounting import calibration as cal

budget = cal.epsilon_budget(3.0, delta=1e-5)
result = cal.calibrate(
    budget,
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), sample_rate=0.01) * 1000,
    param_min=0.1,
    param_max=5.0,
)
print(f"noise_multiplier = {result.param:.4f}, epsilon = {result.achieved:.6f}")
```

Every successful result is privacy-safe and relatively close to the target:
decreasing privacy-loss budgets return `achieved <= target`, while increasing
privacy-gain budgets return `achieved >= target`. In both cases,
`math.isclose(achieved, target, rel_tol=tolerance, abs_tol=0.0)` is true.
`tolerance` must be finite and positive, and `max_iterations` must be positive;
invalid values raise `CalibrationError` before the process is evaluated. If no
safe endpoint reaches the requested relative tolerance, `calibrate()` raises
`CalibrationError` instead of returning an under-noised parameter.

When the process uses a Monte Carlo PLD, calibration divides the configured
failure probability across the two endpoint probes and at most
`max_iterations` interior probes. `result.mc_confidence` therefore covers the
adaptive search as a whole rather than only its selected final parameter.

Calibrating a second stage against the remaining budget (see
[Seeding with a prior process](#seeding-with-a-prior-process)): pass the
earlier run's executed process as `prefix`. Each probe evaluates
`prefix | process(param)`, so the budget is the total across both stages.
The prefix's PLD is computed once for the whole search.

```python
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.epsilon_budget(8.0, delta=1e-6),
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.02) * 2000,
    param_min=0.5,
    param_max=5.0,
    prefix=sft.process,  # from the SFT run's accountant.json
)
```

Multi-phase training:

```python
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.epsilon_budget(5.0, delta=1e-5),
    lambda nm: (
        dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.01) * 500
        | dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm * 0.8), 0.01) * 500
        | dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm * 0.5), 0.01) * 500
    ),
    param_min=0.2,
    param_max=3.0,
    tolerance=0.01,
)
```

### `CalibrateResult`

Returned by `calibrate()`.

| Attribute   | Type    | Description                                      |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `param`     | `float` | Found parameter value                            |
| `achieved`  | `float` | Achieved metric value at `param`                 |
| `target`    | `float` | Target metric value                              |
| `iterations`| `int`   | Number of binary search iterations               |
| `converged` | `bool`  | Always `True` for a successfully returned result |
| `mc_failure_probability` | `float` | Overall failure probability for adaptive MC probes |
| `mc_confidence` | `float` | Confidence covering the complete calibration search |

### Budget Factories

Budget factories create `Budget` objects that define what privacy metric to
optimize and what value to achieve.

| Factory                             | Metric being calibrated                 | Decreasing with noise |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `cal.epsilon_budget(eps, delta)`    | epsilon at given delta                  | Yes                   |
| `cal.delta_budget(delta, epsilon)`  | delta at given epsilon                  | Yes                   |
| `cal.advantage_budget(advantage)`   | f-DP total-variation advantage          | Yes                   |
| `cal.beta_budget(beta, alpha)`      | Type-II error at given Type-I error     | No                    |
| `cal.risk_budget(risk, prior)`      | Bayes risk under optimal adversary      | No                    |

"Decreasing with noise" indicates the metric kind: privacy-loss metrics
(epsilon/delta/advantage) are safe at-or-below the target, privacy-gain
metrics (beta/risk) at-or-above. The binary search derives the parameter
direction automatically by probing both bracket endpoints.

```python
# (epsilon, delta)-DP
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.epsilon_budget(3.0, delta=1e-5),
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.01) * 1000,
    0.1, 5.0,
)

# f-DP advantage
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.advantage_budget(0.1),
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.01) * 1000,
    0.2, 3.0,
)

# (alpha, beta) error rates
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.beta_budget(0.05, alpha=0.01),
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.01) * 1000,
    0.2, 3.0,
)

# Bayes risk
result = cal.calibrate(
    cal.risk_budget(0.1, prior=0.5),
    lambda nm: dpsgd_acc.poisson(dpsgd_acc.gaussian(nm), 0.01) * 1000,
    0.2, 3.0,
)
```
