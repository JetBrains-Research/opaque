# DP-FTRL end-to-end

This guide walks through the full DP-FTRL pipeline: pick a
matrix-factorization strategy, calibrate the noise multiplier for the
*whole training run*, clip gradients, add correlated MF noise, run an
explicit-state optimizer step, and checkpoint state. DP-FTRL-specific imports
on this page come from the `opaque.dpftrl.*` public façade; shared state,
optimizer, RNG, and accounting APIs use their own public namespaces.

For DP-FTRL theory and a side-by-side comparison of mechanisms, see
[DP-FTRL mechanisms](../mechanisms/dp-ftrl/index.md). For the DP-SGD
counterpart, see [DP-SGD end-to-end](dp-sgd.md).

Install `opaque-dpftrl` together with a provider wheel, or use the root extra
`opaque[dpftrl]`, which brings `opaque-torch`. The first gradient template
passed to `mf_gaussian_noise` selects the provider; gradients, noised outputs,
correlation buffers, and paired second-moment streams all stay native to it, at
their input dtype and device. See
[Providers, dtype, and state](noise.md#providers-dtype-and-state).

## Why DP-FTRL

DP-FTRL adds **correlated** Gaussian noise across training steps via
matrix factorization. Compared to independent noise at each step
(DP-SGD), correlated noise reduces variance on the **cumulative**
updates that the optimizer actually applies, for the same calibrated
privacy guarantee.

The trade-off: DP-FTRL accountants describe **whole training runs**.
The amplification factory takes `n_steps` at calibration time, the
strategy commits to a sensitivity / Gram matrix at construction time,
and the noise mechanism latches the per-step contribution bound on
the first call. Changing the training length, the per-step bound, or
the strategy mid-run breaks the privacy claim.

## Privacy and workload assumptions

Use the same strategy in `mf_gaussian_noise` and accounting, and pair
the sampler with its amplification factory. A strategy's workload model
(optimizer, schedule, and accumulation) affects utility; changing it
does not itself extend the documented privacy analysis.

## 1. Strategy choice

Pick a matrix-factorization strategy by mechanism. The strategy
object holds: coefficients defining the lower-triangular linear map
used for noise, the sensitivity (and sometimes a Gram matrix) used by
the accountant, and a streaming representation for efficient noise
generation.

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import (
    band_mf_strategy,    # numerical Toeplitz optimization
    blt_strategy,        # buffered linear Toeplitz, multi-epoch
    bisr_strategy,       # banded inverse square root
    bsr_strategy,        # banded square root, closed-form
    lambda_cgd_strategy, # PRNG replay, O(1) memory
    identity_strategy,   # no correlation; baseline
)

strategy = band_mf_strategy(bands=10)
```

Strategies are provider-independent host recipes. Their
`coefficients(n_steps=..., min_sep=..., max_participations=...)` queries return
NumPy arrays for inspection and accounting, while `mf_gaussian_noise` projects
the recipe into an immutable numeric execution plan and applies that plan to
provider-native arrays.

See [DP-FTRL mechanisms](../mechanisms/dp-ftrl/index.md) for the
choice criteria.

## 2. Calibration

DP-FTRL accountants describe a whole training run. Build the strategy
first, then build the matching accounting mechanism using its
sensitivity / Gram matrix:

```python
import opaque.accounting as acc                  # cross-cutting
import opaque.dpftrl.accounting as dpftrl_acc    # DP-FTRL factories

# Same strategy that will go into mf_gaussian_noise below.
strategy = band_mf_strategy(bands=10)

result = acc.calibrate(
    acc.epsilon_budget(3.0, delta=1e-5),
    lambda nm: dpftrl_acc.poisson(
        dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(nm, strategy),
        sample_rate=0.01,
        n_steps=1000,
    ),
    param_min=0.1, param_max=5.0,
)
noise_multiplier = result.param
```

Three amplification factories under
`opaque.dpftrl.accounting` — pick the one that matches your sampler:

- `dpftrl_acc.poisson(...)` — Poisson subsampling (cyclic-Poisson
  under banded MF).
- `dpftrl_acc.b_min_sep(...)` — b-min-separation participation
  pattern.
- `dpftrl_acc.balls_in_bins(...)` — fixed-partition participation.

Each amplification factory wraps a mechanism into a single
`DpProcess` describing the full training run. **Always pass the same
strategy object** to `mf_gaussian_noise` and the accounting factory — that is
how DP correctness is preserved.

### Step-by-step ε reporting (`per_step`)

DP-FTRL processes are *whole-process*: feeding the bare process to
`Accountant`'s `acct |= step` would over-count. Wrap with
`acc.per_step(...)` to get a step-shaped adapter whose
`per_step(proc) * K` materialises the strategy-aware K-prefix PLD —
identical in shape to the DP-SGD `acct |= step` idiom but with the
correct K-step bound under MF correlations:

```python
proc = dpftrl_acc.poisson(
    dpftrl_acc.mf_gaussian(noise_multiplier, strategy),
    sample_rate=0.01,
    n_steps=1000,
)
step = acc.per_step(proc)
acct = Accountant(budget=acc.epsilon_budget(3.0, delta=1e-5))

for batch in dataloader:
    # ... train ...
    acct |= step
    eps_so_far = acct.epsilon_at(delta=1e-5)
```

For analytic PLDs, K-step ε is monotone and bounded by full-horizon ε.
For Monte Carlo-backed b-min-sep and correlated Balls-in-Bins, every nonzero
prefix charges the full-horizon confidence bound, preserving those invariants
at the cost of prefix tightness. `K > proc.n_steps` raises.

## 3. Clipping

Same engine clipping primitives as DP-SGD, just imported from
`opaque.dpftrl.clipping`. Adaptive clipping is **not** available
under DP-FTRL — its threshold drifts across steps, violating the
constant per-step sensitivity assumption MF privacy proofs require.

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.clipping import clipped_grad

def loss_fn(params, batch):
    return loss

grad_fn, clip_state = clipped_grad(
    loss_fn,
    clipping_norm=1.0,
    argnums=0,
    batch_argnums=1,
    normalize_by=batch_size,
)
```

`auto_clipped_grad` (AUTO-S) is also available and compatible with
DP-FTRL — its per-record sensitivity bound
`sup ‖R · g / (‖g‖ + γ)‖ ≤ R` is constant in the input, satisfying
the same invariant MF accounting requires of fixed clipping.

Use scalar `clipped_grad` by default. Use `per_group` when groups have
materially different gradient scales, with bounds near their typical
norms; use `auto_clipped_grad` when avoiding a fixed threshold is more
important than tuning one.

## 4. Noise

`opaque.dpftrl.noise.mf_gaussian_noise` injects correlated noise:

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.noise import mf_gaussian_noise
from opaque.random import key

# grad_template is the structure of clipped_grad's output —
# typically a ClippedPytree from a single warm-up call.
warmup_grads, _ = grad_fn(params, warmup_batch, state=clip_state)

noise_fn, noise_state = mf_gaussian_noise(
    warmup_grads,
    strategy,                       # same object you used in accounting
    n_steps=1000,                   # total training steps
    noise_multiplier=noise_multiplier,
    key=key(0),
    compute_dtype=None,              # active provider's float32
)
```

The `grad_template` and each later clipped pytree must contain native arrays
from the same provider. Internal noise and correlation state use
`compute_dtype`; `None` deliberately resolves to provider `float32`, while the
returned leaves are cast back to their input dtypes and remain on their input
devices.

`mf_gaussian_noise` reads the per-step contribution bound from the
`ClippedPytree` input on the **first call** and latches it for the
rest of the run. The bound is `noise_multiplier × max_norm`, so each
step must produce gradients with the same `max_norm` for the privacy
claim to hold.

For private second-moment estimation, pass
`second_moment_strategy=...`; the joint allocation is accounted with
the same mechanism PLD as the first-moment release. See
[Optimizers](optimizers.md) and [Noise](noise.md).

## 5. Sampling

DP-FTRL has its own sampler family under `opaque.dpftrl.sampling`:

```python
from opaque.dpftrl.sampling import (
    CyclicPoissonSampler,    # banded MF: cyclic Poisson subsampling
    BMinSepSampler,          # b-min-separation
    BallsInBinsSampler,      # fixed-partition
    SequentialBatchSampler,  # deterministic order, used by BLT
)

sampler = CyclicPoissonSampler(
    dataset, sample_rate=0.01, bands=10, n_steps=1000, key=key(42),
)
```

The sampler must match the amplification factory you used in
calibration.

## 6. Optimizer

Same surface as DP-SGD:

```python
from opaque.optimizers import adamw

optimizer_step, opt_state = adamw(params, lr=1e-3, noise_bias_correction=True)
```

Private second-moment AdamW pairs with `mf_gaussian_noise(...,
second_moment_strategy=...)` — the noise mechanism produces a
`SecondMomentNoiseOutput` and the optimizer's DP-aware path consumes
it. See [Optimizers](optimizers.md) for the full second-moment story.

**Stability under the paired release.** Adam-family stability remains
workload-dependent. Watch clipping rate and gradient norms; lowering
the learning rate or using suitable per-group bounds can help.

## 7. End-to-end loop

```python
from opaque.optimizers import apply_updates
from opaque.serialization import state_dict

for step, batch in enumerate(sampler):
    grads, clip_state = grad_fn(params, batch, state=clip_state)
    noised, noise_state = noise_fn(grads, noise_state)
    updates, opt_state = optimizer_step(noised, opt_state, params=params)
    params = apply_updates(params, updates)

# Hand this flat mapping to the application's checkpoint writer.
checkpoint = state_dict({
    "params": params,
    "opt_state": opt_state,
    "clip_state": clip_state,
    "noise_state": noise_state,
})
```

Obtain functional `params` with `opaque.torch.functional.make_functional`.

To resume, reconstruct the clipping, optimizer, and MF noise mechanisms with
the same configuration, assemble a matching state template, and call
`from_state_dict(template, checkpoint)`. Native-array handlers preserve
provider-native state leaves when restored against a matching provider template.
The restored `MFNoiseState` or `SecondMomentMFNoiseState` carries the saved key,
step counter, and provider-native correlation buffers, so the next noise call
matches uninterrupted execution within that provider.
