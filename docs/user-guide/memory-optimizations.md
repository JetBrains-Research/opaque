# Memory Optimizations

DP-SGD training with `vmap(grad())` is memory-intensive: per-example gradients
require materializing one gradient copy per sample. This page covers all
available techniques for reducing memory usage.

## Understanding vmap memory

In standard training, a forward-backward pass produces one gradient tensor
per parameter — the batch dimension is implicit. With `vmap`, each example
in the batch gets its own gradient copy, so memory scales as:

$$\text{peak} \approx P + M \cdot P + A$$

where $P$ is model parameters, $M$ is the microbatch size (or full batch
size if no microbatching), and $A$ is activation memory. The $M \cdot P$
term dominates for large models.

| Model size | Full batch (256) | Microbatch 16 | Microbatch 1 |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 125M (GPT-2) | ~32 GB | ~2 GB | ~125 MB |
| 7B (LLaMA) | infeasible | ~112 GB | ~7 GB |
| 7B + LoRA r=8 | ~2.5 GB | ~160 MB | ~10 MB |

LoRA dramatically reduces gradient memory because only the adapter
parameters (~0.1% of the model) require per-example gradients. Use
`make_functional(model, partition_trainable=True)` to expose only the
trainable subset to `vmap(grad(...))` — see [Utilities reference —
`make_functional`](../reference/utilities.md#trainable-frozen-partition-for-peft-and-lora).

## Microbatching

Microbatching reduces $M$ by processing the batch in chunks. With
`microbatch_size=16` and `batch_size=256`, vmap runs 16 forward-backward
passes of 16 examples each, accumulating the clipped gradients. Memory
drops from $256 \cdot P$ to $16 \cdot P$ for the gradient term, at the
cost of 16× more sequential computation.

```python
grad_fn, clip_state = clipped_grad(
    loss_fn,
    clipping_norm=1.0,
    batch_argnums=(1, 2),
    microbatch_size=16,  # process 16 examples at a time
)
```

### Microbatch size vs throughput

Smaller microbatches use less memory but require more passes. Measure the
trade-off on your workload.

### Tuning workflow

Use a short manual sweep with `step_perf`:

```python
from opaque.dpsgd.clipping import clipped_grad
from opaque.profiling import reset_peak_memory, step_perf

def try_microbatch(candidate_mb: int) -> float:
    grad_fn, clip_state = clipped_grad(
        loss_fn,
        clipping_norm=1.0,
        batch_argnums=(1, 2),
        microbatch_size=candidate_mb,
    )

    reset_peak_memory(device)
    with step_perf(device, batch_size=len(batch_x)) as perf:
        _grads, _aux = grad_fn(params, batch_x, batch_y, state=clip_state)

    return perf.result.memory_peak_gb
```

1. Start with `microbatch_size = batch_size`.
2. Halve until OOM stops.
3. Run a 20-50 step smoke loop.
4. Select the largest stable value.

## Gradient checkpointing

PyTorch's `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint` is supported under
`vmap(grad(...))`. Enable the runtime patch once with
`opaque.patches.apply_runtime_patches()`.

**With PyTorch directly** (non-reentrant checkpoint only):

```python
from opaque.patches import apply_runtime_patches
from torch.utils.checkpoint import checkpoint

apply_runtime_patches()

def my_model(x):
    h = checkpoint(block1, x, use_reentrant=False)
    h = checkpoint(block2, h, use_reentrant=False)
    return h.sum()

with torch.no_grad():
    grads = vmap(grad(my_model))(batch_x)
```

**With Hugging Face models:**

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
# Then proceed with make_functional, clipped_grad, etc.
```

Opaque automatically forces `use_reentrant=False` (the only path compatible
with functorch). No special kwargs needed.

**Memory comparison:**

| Technique | Memory | Compute | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| No optimization | O(batch_size) | 1x | |
| Gradient checkpointing | Workload-dependent | Recomputation overhead | Measure on the target model |
| Microbatching (size m) | O(m) gradient term | More sequential passes | Measure on the target device |

**Limitations:**

- Requires `use_reentrant=False` (the non-reentrant checkpoint path).
  The legacy reentrant path is not supported.
- Supports first-order differentiation only; higher-order transforms still
  reject saved-tensor hooks.
- Checkpointed functional transforms cannot be wrapped with `torch.compile`:
  non-reentrant checkpointing relies on saved-tensor hooks that AOTAutograd
  cannot safely compose with `vmap(grad(...))`.
- Use `torch.no_grad()` for direct `vmap(grad(...))` calls. `clipped_grad` does
  this automatically unless an outer transform differentiates its result.
- Opt out at the patch API layer (no environment-variable kill switches): pass
  `vmap_checkpointing=False` to `apply_runtime_patches(...)` or
  `apply_model_patches(...)`.

### CPU offloading of saved tensors

`opaque.functional.save_on_cpu` selectively moves tensors saved for backward to
CPU during forward and reloads them during backward. By default it uses pageable
host memory, skips tensors smaller than 1 MiB, and leaves tensors or views that
share storage with `protected_tensors` on device. Pass the current functional
parameters as protected tensors; optimizers commonly replace those tensors, so
create a fresh context for each step.

```python
from opaque.functional import SaveOnCpuStats, save_on_cpu

stats = SaveOnCpuStats()
with save_on_cpu(
    protected_tensors=params,
    min_bytes=1 << 20,
    stats=stats,
):
    grads, aux = grad_fn(params, batch)
```

Pinned CUDA offload is an explicit throughput mode. It overlaps at most two D2H
transfers on a dedicated stream and caps pinned allocations at 1 GiB by default;
selected tensors beyond the cap use pageable memory. Tune both limits on the
actual model and device rather than assuming that copying more tensors is faster.

```python
with save_on_cpu(
    pin_memory=True,
    protected_tensors=params,
    max_pinned_bytes=1 << 30,
    stats=stats,
):
    grads, aux = grad_fn(params, batch)
```

`stats.to_dict()` reports selected and skipped tensors/bytes, pageable and pinned
traffic, the peak pinned allocation, maximum in-flight transfers, and D2H time.
With non-reentrant gradient checkpointing, checkpoint's own hooks manage
recomputed intermediates; the outer offload context sees checkpoint inputs such
as inter-layer hidden states. Saved-tensor hooks remain first-order-only and are
not supported around `torch.compile`.

## Fused Triton kernels

Opaque includes fused Triton kernels that replace standard PyTorch operations
in supported models, reducing memory and improving throughput without changing
training semantics. These are enabled by `apply_model_patches(model)` after
runtime patching has been set up.

The kernels reduce memory by eliminating intermediate tensors (fused forward
passes) and recomputing activations in backward instead of saving them. Each
kernel also implements native vmap support, so `vmap(grad())` works without
fallbacks.

See [Model Patches — Triton kernels](huggingface/model-patches.md#triton-kernels)
for per-operation details and per-model support.

### Kernel benchmarks

Kernel performance is workload-dependent; profile patched and unpatched
paths on your workload.

### Fused linear cross-entropy

Computes the loss directly from hidden states and the `lm_head` weight matrix,
never materializing the full `(batch*seq, vocab)` logits tensor. The normal
`performance` patch bucket installs the conditional wrapper; pass
`loss_only=True` only for forwards where logits have no consumer.

The fused branch returns `logits=None`; calls that need logits for metrics,
preprocessing, generation, or a custom loss leave the marker false. Unsupported
loss options also fall back safely.
Cohere and Granite logit scaling is applied inside each tile, avoiding a
transformed copy of the full `lm_head` weight.

Families outside the fused CUDA kernel's numerical envelope can use the
portable chunked backend. It tiles both prediction tokens and vocabulary under
an internal CPU/MPS-aware workspace bound. Configure the loss-only path and an
optional maximum vocabulary-column tile width through:

```python
apply_model_patches(model, chunked_linear_cross_entropy=2048)
```

The fused flag enables the logits-free path; for the chunk-width setting,
`True` selects automatic two-dimensional tiling, a positive integer caps the
vocabulary width while token tiling remains automatic, and `False` or `0`
disables the portable backend.

## Profiling

### step_perf + PerfState

Use `step_perf` to measure individual training steps and `PerfState` to
accumulate throughput statistics across a run.

```python
from opaque.profiling import step_perf, PerfState, print_memory

print_memory(device, "start")
perf_state = PerfState(device=device)

for batch in dataloader:
    with step_perf(device, batch_size=len(batch["input_ids"])) as perf:
        train_step(batch)
        perf.mark("clip")

    perf_state = perf_state.add(perf.result)
    # e.g., perf.result.step_time_sec, perf.result.memory_peak_gb

print_memory(device, "end")
print(perf_state.to_dict(prefix="train/"))
```

For one-off memory snapshots, use `print_memory(device, label)`
or `get_memory_stats(device)`.

### Device support

| Device | Basic profiling | Detailed stats | Component tracking |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| CUDA | Full | Full | Supported |
| MPS | Full | Partial | Supported |
| CPU | Limited | Not available | Supported |

On MPS, `memory_peak_gb` is always scoped to the measured step:

| PyTorch | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| 2.13+ | Exact allocated-memory peak from `torch.accelerator.memory` |
| 2.9–2.12 | Maximum current allocation sampled at entry, marks, and exit |

Add marks after memory-intensive phases to improve the sampled measurement.
`memory_reserved_gb` reports the current Metal-driver allocation, including
allocator caches and MPS/MPSGraph allocations.

Sub-step `.mark()` calls synchronize the device for accurate timing.

### Distributed memory considerations

In DDP training, each rank holds the full model and computes per-example
gradients for its local batch. `AllReduce` temporarily doubles the gradient
memory while summing across ranks. Profile on a single GPU first to
establish the memory baseline, then account for the AllReduce overhead when
scaling.

If memory is tight, reduce `microbatch_size` to leave headroom for AllReduce.
Start from your single-device stable value and reduce by 10-20% for DDP.

## Troubleshooting

**Out of memory:** Reduce `microbatch_size` and re-profile with
`step_perf`. If the model itself does not fit, use LoRA or another
parameter-efficient method to reduce the trainable parameter count.

**Low efficiency (<80%):** Memory fragmentation. Call
`torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between steps, or reduce `microbatch_size`.

**Memory grows over time:** Profile across iterations to identify whether
peak memory is increasing. Check for tensors that are accumulating outside
the training loop (e.g., appending to a list without detaching).

**OOM with fused linear CE not active:** Ensure the `performance` patch bucket
is enabled and pass `loss_only=True` only when logits have no consumer. Otherwise, the
full `(batch*seq, vocab)` tensor is materialized — about 2 GB per sample at 128K
vocabulary — so reduce batch size if logits are required.
