# DP-SGD mechanisms

DP-SGD adds calibrated noise to a clipped gradient at every step.
Privacy is composed step-by-step: each call to the noise mechanism is
a separate `DpProcess`, multiplied by the number of training steps in
the accountant.

## Mechanisms

- **[Gaussian](gaussian.md)** — independent Gaussian noise on the
  clipped gradient; the canonical DP-SGD release.

## Pairing with sampling

DP-SGD typically pairs the Gaussian mechanism with Poisson subsampling
(`opaque.dpsgd.sampling.PoissonSubsampler`). The accounting form is
`opaque.dpsgd.accounting.poisson(opaque.dpsgd.accounting.gaussian(nm),
sample_rate=q)`; multiply by `* num_steps` for full-training privacy.
