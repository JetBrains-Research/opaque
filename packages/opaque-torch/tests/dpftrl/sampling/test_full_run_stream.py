"""Contract tests for full-run sampler streams (issue #357 review).

The DP-FTRL example builds ONE sampler with ``n_steps=total_steps`` and
lets it span every epoch boundary.  These tests pin the properties that
make a single stream the correct sampler lifetime — and that per-epoch
recreation silently violates for the randomized samplers:

* BnB / Sequential: the single stream is byte-identical to same-key
  per-epoch recreation, so switching lifetimes changes no batches.
* BMinSep: min-separation holds across the WHOLE stream.  Recreation
  redraws the warm-start cooldown at each epoch boundary, letting an
  example participate again fewer than ``bands`` steps after its last
  participation of the previous epoch — violating the ``min_sep``
  contract the band-MF accounting sizes noise against.
* CyclicPoisson: the band partition and phase stay fixed across the
  stream; recreation redraws the partition and resets the phase.
