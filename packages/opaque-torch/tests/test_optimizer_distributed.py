"""Tests for Torch optimizer distributed-state sync handlers.

The handlers are audit-only (assert cross-rank equality of optimizer state
structure and leaves), so the multi-rank checks themselves are exercised by
the engine's DDP test suite. These tests cover the single-process invariants:

- Registration happens at import time for every Opaque optimizer state.
- ``sync_optimizer_state`` is a no-op when not distributed (returns input
  unchanged — same object identity for both bare dataclass and chain states).
- Recursion walks tuples / lists / dicts / nested dataclasses / strings /
  unknown leaf types without raising.
