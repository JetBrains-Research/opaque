"""BandMF participation accounting across the three sensitivity consumers.

The un-amplified ``mf_gaussian`` PLD is a *single* Gaussian at
``noise_multiplier / sensitivity`` over the whole horizon, so its
sensitivity must be the participation-aware one.  Both amplified routes
price the repeat participations themselves -- cyclic Poisson by
``self_compose(num_groups)`` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08153, Theorem 4),
b-min-sep by the warm-start recursion
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09338, Section 5) -- so they must keep the
single-participation column norm.  These tests pin both halves.
