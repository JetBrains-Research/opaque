"""Sequential batch sampler for fixed-order training.

This sampler iterates through a dataset sequentially in fixed-size
batches, dropping the last incomplete batch.  It is used by the BLT
(Buffered Linear Toeplitz) mechanism, which requires a deterministic
batch order with fixed ``min_sep`` between participations.

Unlike Poisson or BnB sampling there is no randomness — the dataset
should be pre-shuffled once before constructing the sampler.

class SequentialBatchSampler(Sampler):
    """Deterministic fixed-size sequential batching.

    Yields contiguous, non-overlapping chunks of ``batch_size`` indices
    ``[0, ..., B-1], [B, ..., 2B-1], ...``.  The last chunk is dropped
    when smaller than ``batch_size``.

    With ``n_steps`` set, the fixed batch order cycles: pass 2 repeats
    the identical batches in the identical order, so across the run
    every example participates exactly ``n_steps // num_batches`` times
    with exactly ``num_batches`` steps between participations — the
    ``min_sep`` / ``max_participations`` contract the BLT accounting
    assumes, enforced by one sampler over the whole stream.

    This sampler has no RNG key — it is fully deterministic.
    Call ``dataset.shuffle(seed=...)`` once beforehand to randomise
    which examples land in which batch.

    Args:
        data_source: Dataset to sample from (any object with ``__len__``).
        batch_size: Exact number of examples per batch (must be ≥ 1).
        n_steps: Total number of batches to yield across the run.  Must
            be a positive multiple of the per-pass batch count
            (``len(data_source) // batch_size``), so participation
            counts stay uniform.  ``None`` yields a single pass.

    Example:
        >>> sampler = SequentialBatchSampler(dataset, batch_size=256)
        >>> loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_sampler=sampler)
