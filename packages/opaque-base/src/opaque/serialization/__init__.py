"""Functional serialization for Opaque explicit state objects.

Flattens tensor trees, NumPy arrays, dataclasses, named tuples,
sequences, and string-keyed dicts into a flat ``dict[str, Any]``
suitable for ``torch.save`` / ``torch.load``.

Restore is template-driven: supply a freshly-initialised object of the
same shape as at save time; each path present in the dict overwrites
the corresponding leaf. Missing paths keep the template (forward
compatibility when new fields appear).

Sub-packages may register custom serializers with
:func:`register_serializer`. Lookup is by exact type and then by
``__mro__``, so a subclass of a registered type (``nn.Parameter``
against ``torch.Tensor``) uses the base class handler.
``torch.Tensor``, ``numpy.ndarray``, and ``torch.nn.Parameter``
handlers register automatically when ``opaque-engine`` is loaded;
``opaque-accounting`` registers PLD process types; stack wheels
register their state objects.

A leaf that is neither registered nor a generic container nor a
primitive raises ``TypeError`` on both save and restore rather than
being dropped. Declare the genuinely inert ones — vendor structure
handles and the like — with :func:`register_template_restored`.
