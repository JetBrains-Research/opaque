"""Type-keyed serializer registry.

Each opaque wheel registers handlers for the concrete types it owns:

- ``opaque-engine`` registers ``numpy.ndarray`` and inert tree structures.
- ``opaque-torch``, ``opaque-jax``, and ``opaque-mlx`` register native arrays
  when their provider is activated.
- ``opaque-accounting`` registers ``Accountant`` and every
  ``DpProcess`` subclass via ``__init_subclass__``.
- ``opaque-dpsgd`` / ``opaque-dpftrl`` register stack-specific state
  classes (e.g. clipping / noise state objects).

The registry holds an exact-type mapping; subclass dispatch is handled by
:func:`resolve_serializer`, which walks ``__mro__`` so a subclass reaches its
registered base-class handler instead of falling through to the generic walker.
