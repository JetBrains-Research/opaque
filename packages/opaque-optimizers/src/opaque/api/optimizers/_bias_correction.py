"""DP noise-variance bias correction (φ-EMA).

Shared primitive for any second-moment optimizer (Adam, AdEMAMix,
Adafactor, …) that wants to subtract the noise variance from its
``v̂_t`` estimate under DP-SGD.

Reference:
    Chooi et al., "DP-AdamW: Investigating Decoupled Weight Decay and
    Bias Correction in Private Deep Learning", arXiv:2511.07843.

Math.  Let ``Φ_t = σ_t²`` be the per-step noise *variance*.  The
``φ`` EMA tracks the same β₂-weighted average as the second-moment
EMA::

    φ_t = β₂ φ_{t-1} + (1 − β₂) Φ_t

After bias correction by ``1 − β₂^t``, ``φ̂_t = φ_t / (1 − β₂^t)`` is
an unbiased estimate of the noise-variance contribution to ``v̂_t``::

    v̂_corrected = v̂_t − φ̂_t   where that is positive
                  v̂_t         elsewhere

Coordinates where the noise estimate has overtaken the second moment are
left *uncorrected* rather than clamped to a small positive floor.  Their
signal-variance estimate is non-positive and therefore meaningless;
flooring would divide by ``≈ ε`` and amplify pure noise by ~1/ε, whereas
falling back to ``v̂_t`` degrades them to the non-private behavior, which
is bounded.  The additive ``ε`` in ``√v̂_corrected + ε`` is what keeps the
denominator away from zero.

The separate ``bc_floor`` clamp seen in some optimizers belongs to the
*private second-moment* branch (``noisy_squared_grads``), where ``v̂``
comes from an externally privatised ``g²`` stream and can be genuinely
negative — not to this φ-EMA path.

This module is mechanism-agnostic.  ``noise_stddev`` is a number (or a
``PerGroup`` of numbers) supplied by the caller; the noise *generation*
lives elsewhere (``opaque.dpsgd.noise``, ``opaque.dpftrl.noise``).
