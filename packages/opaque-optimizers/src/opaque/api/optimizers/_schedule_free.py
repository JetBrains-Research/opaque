"""Schedule-Free wrapper (Defazio et al., 2024).

Composes around any base ``GradientTransformation`` (Adam, AdamW,
Lion, AdEMAMix, …) to give it Defazio's schedule-free averaging — a
training mode that produces published checkpoints from a Polyak-Ruppert-
style uniform average rather than relying on an external LR schedule
(warmup, cosine, …).

Reference:
    Defazio, Yaida, Cutkosky, "The Road Less Scheduled",
    arXiv:2405.15682.

Three weight sequences::

    z_t  : raw iterate updated by the wrapped optimizer
    x_t  : uniform-averaged "published" weights (saved checkpoint)
    y_t  : interpolation y_t = (1 − β) z_t + β x_{t-1} — used for
           forward passes during training

Update step (gradient computed at ``y_t``)::

    g_t   = ∇L(y_t)
    z_{t+1} = z_t − wrapped_optimizer_update(g_t)
    x_{t+1} = (1 − 1/(t+1)) x_t + (1/(t+1)) z_{t+1}
    y_{t+1} = (1 − β) z_{t+1} + β x_{t+1}

The wrapper presents the standard ``GradientTransformation`` interface,
but its update returns a delta that takes the trainer's ``params``
(treated as ``y_t``) to ``y_{t+1}``.

DP / privacy notes.

- The privacy mechanism (clipping, noise) attaches to the gradient at
  ``y_t`` exactly as in vanilla DP-SGD; the published average ``x_t``
  is a deterministic function of the (already-private) ``z`` trajectory,
  so by post-processing the privacy guarantee is unchanged.
- Wrapped optimizers consume ``NoisedPytree`` / ``SecondMomentNoiseOutput`` on
  ``updates`` as usual (same as without this wrapper); the public ``update``
  surface does not add DP metadata kwargs.

Trainer-integration caveat (Phase B).  The wrapper's published params
are ``x_t``, not the ``params`` argument the trainer passes in
(``y_t``).  Saving / evaluating against ``y_t`` would defeat the
purpose of schedule-free averaging.  The wrapper exposes the published
params as the ``x`` field of :class:`ScheduleFreeState`, which trainer
integrations should consult at save / eval boundaries.  This is the
dependency that gates schedule-free's usefulness through ``DPTrainer``;
the wrapper itself is correct end-to-end as a library API.
