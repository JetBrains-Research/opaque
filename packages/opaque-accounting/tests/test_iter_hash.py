"""Hashing arbitrarily deep ``DpProcess`` composition trees is safe.

Builds the worst-case shapes — long left-skewed and right-skewed
``Composed`` chains, periodic ``cached(...)`` barriers, and
``Repeated`` wrappers around deep inner chains — and asserts
``hash(tree)`` returns a finite value (no ``RecursionError``). Also
asserts the hash / equality contract: structurally-equal trees
produce equal hashes, structurally-distinct trees produce distinct
hashes.
