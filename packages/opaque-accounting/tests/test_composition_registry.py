"""Composed/Repeated DpProcess registration must fire at import time.

``_PROCESS_REGISTRY`` is filled by the dataclass ``__init_subclass__``
hook on :class:`DpProcess` subclasses; deserialization
(:func:`opaque.api.accounting.core._process_codec._load_dp_process`)
looks types up by name from that registry.  If the composition module
imports :class:`Composed` / :class:`Repeated` lazily, plain
``import opaque.accounting`` leaves the registry incomplete and
round-tripping a tree containing those nodes fails with
``ValueError: Unknown nested DpProcess type 'Composed' in field 'inner'``.

Tests use only opaque-accounting-owned process types (EpsDelta,
Composed, Repeated, CachedProcess) so they don't require opaque-dpsgd
or opaque-dpftrl.
