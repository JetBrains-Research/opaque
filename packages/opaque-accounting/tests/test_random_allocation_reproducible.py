"""Random-allocation ε is bit-identical across thread counts.

The Monte Carlo primitive this replaced could not satisfy this: every MC
driver shards by ``rayon::current_num_threads()`` and seeds ``seed + tid``,
so its ε depends on how many cores the machine happened to have.  Two
people auditing the same run on different hardware got different numbers.

That is the whole point of the deterministic transform, so it is a
regression test rather than a nice-to-have.  Each thread count runs in a
fresh subprocess because ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` is read once when the global
pool is built — setting it in-process after the first PLD would be a no-op
and the test would pass vacuously.
