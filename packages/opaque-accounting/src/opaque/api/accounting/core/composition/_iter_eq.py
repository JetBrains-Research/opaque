"""Iterative equality for arbitrarily-nested ``DpProcess`` composition trees.

Mirrors :mod:`._iter_hash`: the composition wrappers (``Composed``,
``Repeated``, ``CachedProcess``) delegate ``__eq__`` here so structural
comparison of deep chains is bounded by heap rather than
``sys.getrecursionlimit()``.  Non-wrapper leaves compare via their own
``__eq__``, which is safe because leaves hold no unbounded ``DpProcess``
spine.

Semantics are identical to the dataclass-generated ``__eq__`` each wrapper
previously carried: same-class requirement, field-by-field comparison.  The
hash/eq contract with :func:`._iter_hash.iter_hash` is preserved — both walk
the same structure with the same wrapper tags.
