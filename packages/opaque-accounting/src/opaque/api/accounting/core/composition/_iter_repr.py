"""Iterative repr for arbitrarily-nested ``DpProcess`` composition trees.

Mirrors :mod:`._iter_hash` / :mod:`._iter_eq`: the composition wrappers
delegate ``__repr__`` here so deep chains — left- or right-skewed
``Composed`` spines and the ``cached(acct)``-per-round alternation the
:class:`._cached.CachedProcess` docstring recommends — render without
overflowing the interpreter stack.  Output is string-identical to the
dataclass-generated reprs.

Repr tokens stream through an explicit stack into one chunk buffer, so
live memory is proportional to the final string rather than quadratic in
spine depth.  A child shared by two parents is re-walked per occurrence;
the walk stays time-proportional to the output, which is itself what
grows under sharing.  Non-wrapper leaves render via their own ``repr``,
which is safe because leaves hold no unbounded ``DpProcess`` spine.
