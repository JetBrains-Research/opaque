"""Iterative hash for arbitrarily-nested ``DpProcess`` composition trees.

Walks the entire tree with an explicit stack so hash depth is bounded
by available heap rather than ``sys.getrecursionlimit()``. The
composition wrappers (``Composed``, ``Repeated``, ``CachedProcess``)
delegate ``__hash__`` here; non-wrapper leaves (``GaussianMechanism``,
``Identity``, ``EpsDelta``, ``NonPrivate``, …) are hashed via their
own ``__hash__``, which is safe because leaves hold no ``DpProcess``
field.

Hashes are consistent with the dataclass ``__eq__`` of each wrapper:
structurally-equal trees produce equal hashes; structurally-distinct
trees produce distinct hashes (modulo standard hash collisions).
