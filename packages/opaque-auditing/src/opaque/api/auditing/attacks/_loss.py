    """Compute membership scores as negative per-example loss.

    Higher score = lower loss = more likely a training member.
    Uses ``torch.func.vmap`` for per-example loss computation, following
    the same ``batch_argnums`` convention as :func:`~opaque.clipped_grad`.

    The scorer builds its own loader over the partition's canaries and
    pairs every score with the dataset index of the example that produced
    it, returning :class:`~opaque.auditing.types.CanaryScores` — the form
    :func:`~opaque.auditing.one_run` requires.  The pairing is joined by
    identifier, so no iteration order over the batches can misalign it.
    ``collate_fn`` receives the raw canary examples and must return one
    row per example in the order it received them; identifiers are
    attached per batch before collation, so a ``collate_fn`` that reorders
    within a batch does misalign the pairing and cannot be detected.

    To audit scores computed by some other pipeline, attest their
    identifiers with :func:`~opaque.auditing.canary_scores` instead.

    When ``reference_scores`` are provided, the returned scores are
    ``current - reference``, which equals ``loss(w0) - loss(wt)``
    (the loss reduction from initial to current model). This matches
    Algorithm 3 of Steinke et al. (2023).  The reference is aligned by
    identifier before subtraction.

    Args:
        loss_fn: Per-example loss function, same as used with
            :func:`~opaque.clipped_grad`. Must be vmap-compatible.
        *args: Non-batched arguments to ``loss_fn`` (e.g., model parameters).
        batch_argnums: Indices of ``loss_fn`` positional arguments that come
            from dataset batches. Must be sorted, unique, non-negative.
        coin_flip: The audit partition to score against.
        dataset: The full dataset the partition was created from; canaries
            are selected internally by identifier.
        reference_scores: Baseline scores from an untrained model, over the
            same partition. When provided, returned scores are the loss
            reduction ``scores - reference_scores``. Typically obtained by
            calling ``loss_scores`` on the untrained model before training.
        batch_size: Batch size of the internal loader. Defaults to 32.
        collate_fn: Collation for the internal loader. Defaults to
            ``torch.utils.data.default_collate``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~opaque.auditing.types.CanaryScores`, shape ``(n,)``:
        negated losses (higher = more likely member), optionally adjusted
        by reference scores, each carrying its canary's dataset index.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``batch_argnums`` is malformed, ``batch_size`` is
            not positive, or ``collate_fn`` changes the batch row count.
        TypeError: If ``batch_size`` is not an int, or ``reference_scores``
            does not carry identifiers.
