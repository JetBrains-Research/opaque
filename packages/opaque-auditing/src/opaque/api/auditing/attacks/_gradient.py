"""Gradient-norm membership scoring for privacy auditing (white-box).

Computes per-example membership scores using the squared L2 norm of the
gradient of the loss with respect to model parameters.  Members have
small gradient norms (the model has converged on them), producing higher
scores.  This is the first-order approximation of the Bayes-optimal
membership test statistic (Sablayrolles et al. 2019).

Uses the same ``batch_argnums`` convention as :func:`opaque.clipped_grad`
and :func:`~opaque.api.auditing.attacks._loss.loss_scores`.

    Higher score = smaller gradient norm = more likely a training member.
    The model parameters must be the first positional argument to
    ``loss_fn`` (position 0), matching the default ``argnums=0`` of
    :func:`~opaque.clipped_grad`.

    Scores the partition's canaries over an internal identifier-carrying
    loader and returns :class:`~opaque.auditing.types.CanaryScores`, which
    :func:`~opaque.auditing.one_run` requires.  Identifiers are attached
    per batch before collation, so ``collate_fn`` must emit one row per
    example in the order it received them; reordering within a batch
    misaligns the pairing undetectably.  To audit scores computed by some
    other pipeline, attest their identifiers with
    :func:`~opaque.auditing.canary_scores` instead.

    Processes one sample at a time to keep peak GPU memory at 2× model
    size regardless of model or batch size.  ``torch.func.grad`` is a
    functional transform that operates independently of the standard
    autograd context, so the loop runs inside ``torch.no_grad()`` for
    efficiency (same as :func:`~opaque.api.auditing.attacks._loss.loss_scores`).

    When ``reference_scores`` are provided, the returned scores are
    ``current - reference``, which equals
    ``||∇loss(θ₀)||² - ||∇loss(θₜ)||²`` (positive when the current model
    has smaller gradients, i.e. is more converged).  This matches the calibration pattern
    of :func:`~opaque.api.auditing.attacks._loss.loss_scores`.  The
    reference is aligned by identifier before subtraction.

    Args:
        loss_fn: Per-example loss function whose first argument is the
            model parameters (a tensor or PyTree).  Must return a scalar.
        *args: Non-batched arguments to ``loss_fn`` (e.g., model parameters).
            The first element is differentiated.
        batch_argnums: Indices of ``loss_fn`` positional arguments that come
            from dataset batches.  Must not include 0 (reserved for params).
            Must be sorted, unique, non-negative.
        coin_flip: The audit partition to score against.
        dataset: The full dataset the partition was created from; canaries
            are selected internally by identifier.
        reference_scores: Baseline scores from an untrained model, over the
            same partition.  When provided, returned scores are
            ``scores - reference_scores``.  Typically obtained by calling
            ``gradient_scores`` on the untrained model before training.
        batch_size: Batch size of the internal loader. Defaults to 32.
        collate_fn: Collation for the internal loader. Defaults to
            ``torch.utils.data.default_collate``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~opaque.auditing.types.CanaryScores`, shape ``(n,)``:
        negated squared gradient norms (higher = more likely member),
        optionally adjusted by reference scores, each carrying its
        canary's dataset index.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``0 in batch_argnums`` (params must be at position
            0), ``batch_size`` is not positive, or ``collate_fn`` changes
            the batch row count.
        TypeError: If ``batch_size`` is not an int, or ``reference_scores``
            does not carry identifiers.
