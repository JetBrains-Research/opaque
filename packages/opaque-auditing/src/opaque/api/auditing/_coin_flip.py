"""Coin-flip partitioning for canary-based privacy auditing.

Shared infrastructure used by all auditing approaches (OneRun, Nasr, etc.).
Each canary is independently included or excluded from training with
probability 0.5 (a fair coin flip).

Membership scores enter the estimator as :class:`CanaryScores`: each score
carries the dataset index of the canary it was computed for, and
:meth:`CoinFlip.split_scores` joins scores to coin-flip labels by that
identifier.  The order scores arrive in therefore cannot misalign them
against the labels — wrong, missing, or duplicated identifiers raise
instead.  Whether each score carries the *right* identifier is settled
earlier, when the score is produced; see :func:`canary_scores`.
