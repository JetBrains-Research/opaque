"""CPU (non-distributed) behavior of the rank/gather helper extensions.

These wrap ``torch.distributed`` but must degrade gracefully when no
process group is initialized: rank 0, world size 1, no-op barrier, and
``gather_for_metrics`` returning its input unchanged. Multi-rank collective behavior is exercised here with Gloo and by the CUDA
tests in ``test_collectives.py``.
