"""PyTree utilities for working with nested parameter structures.

This module provides utilities for working with PyTrees, i.e. nested Python
containers (dicts, lists, tuples, …) whose leaves are tensors. We implement a
thin wrapper on top of `optree` to provide a stable, fast pytree API that does
not depend on PyTorch's private modules.

Key functions:
- `tree_leaves(tree)`: return the list of tensor leaves in a PyTree.
- `tree_map(fn, *trees)`: apply a function to corresponding leaves of one or
  more PyTrees and rebuild the structure.
- `global_norm(tree)`: compute the global L2 norm across all tensor leaves:
  sqrt(sum(||leaf||^2)).

Notes
- Only tensor leaves are considered for `tree_leaves` and `global_norm`.
- `tree_map` applies `fn` to all leaves, passing through non-tensor leaves
  unchanged unless `fn` handles them explicitly.
- Supports mixed dtypes and complex numbers, returning complex norm for complex tensors.
- Handles empty trees gracefully, returning 0.0 for empty PyTrees.
- Supports PyTree parameters with nested dictionaries of tensors.
- Handles microbatching for memory efficiency in gradient clipping.
