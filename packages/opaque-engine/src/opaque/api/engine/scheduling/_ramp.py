"""Named ramp shapes — used by :class:`~._with_warmup.WithWarmup` and
the warmup phase of :class:`~._warmup_stable_decay.WarmupStableDecay`.

A ramp is a function ``progress ∈ [0, 1] → factor ∈ [0, 1]`` that goes
from ``0`` at the start of the warmup to ``1`` at the end.  The lookup
table maps a string discriminator (``"linear"``, ``"cosine"``,
``"1-sqrt"``) to the matching shape function so composition recipes can
store the discriminator and stay serializable.

Callable overrides are accepted by :func:`resolve_ramp` as an escape
hatch for power-user shapes; the resulting recipe is a valid Schedule
at runtime but won't round-trip through the universal serializer.
