    r"""AUTO-S automatic scaling of a PyTree (Bu et al., NeurIPS 2023).

    Scales the PyTree by ``R / (\|pytree\| + gamma)`` so the output L2
    norm is clipped by ``R`` for any input. Unlike :func:`clip_pytree`, there
    is no threshold to tune — every example contributes an approximately
    unit-length update, with the effective step size absorbed into the
    learning rate.

    Args:
        pytree: Tensor pytree to scale (flat or nested).
        R: Output sensitivity bound (non-negative). When ``PerGroup``, each
            group is scaled independently to its own bound; leaf paths must
            match ``R.groups`` exactly.
        gamma: Small positive denominator stabilizer :math:`\gamma` (default
            0.01). Must be strictly positive; at ``gamma=0`` this reduces to
            AUTO-V (undefined at zero gradient).
        compute_dtype: Internal dtype for the L2-norm reduction and leaf
            scaling. ``None`` (default) auto-promotes bf16/fp16 inputs to
            float32.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (scaled_pytree, aux) where ``aux.norm`` is the original L2
        norm and ``aux.group_norms`` carries per-group norms in per-group
        mode.

    Formal guarantee:
        For every input, the output has L2 norm at most ``R`` (scalar case)
        or :math:`\sqrt{\sum_k R_k^2}` (per-group case).  The bound holds on
        the values as *stored*: each leaf is scaled in ``compute_dtype`` (never
        below its storage precision) and cast once to its output dtype.  The
        scale is shrunk by the final cast's rounding margin so the result cannot
        exceed ``R``. Unlike :func:`clip_pytree` there is no ``min(1, ...)``, so
        the shrink applies to every input — roughly 0.4% of the output magnitude
        at bfloat16, 0.05% at float16, and a few ULPs at float32.

    NaN/Inf values are sanitized to zero before scaling, matching the
    behavior of :func:`clip_pytree`.

        compute_dtype: Internal dtype for the L2-norm reduction and leaf
            scaling. ``None`` (default) auto-promotes bf16/fp16 inputs to
            float32. This keeps the sensitivity bound numerically honest under
            low-precision compute — small per-element contributions don't get
            rounded away during the sum-of-squares or multiplication.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (clipped_pytree, aux) where aux contains:
            - norm: The L2 norm of the original (unclipped) pytree

    Edge cases:
        - clipping_norm=0: Returns zeros
        - clipping_norm=inf: No clipping (passthrough)
        - pytree_norm=0: Returns unchanged
        - NaN/Inf values: Replaced with zeros before clipping
        - return_zero=True: Returns zeros regardless of other parameters
