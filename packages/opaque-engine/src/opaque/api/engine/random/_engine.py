"""Generic RNG engine with JAX-style key semantics.

This module provides explicit, immutable RNG state transitions inspired by JAX:

- ``key(seed)`` creates an initial key
- ``split(key, n)`` derives independent child keys
- ``fold_in(key, data)`` domain-separates by deterministic metadata

The engine is backend-agnostic and can be bridged to PyTorch via
``generator_from_key`` when APIs require ``torch.Generator``.

def fold_in(rng_key: RngKey, *data: int | str) -> RngKey:
    """Fold one or more values into a key to deterministically derive a new key.

    Accepts a variable number of int/str arguments. Each value is folded
    sequentially, so ``fold_in(k, a, b)`` equals ``fold_in(fold_in(k, a), b)``.

    Integers and strings are hashed down disjoint paths: ``fold_in(k, 1)`` and
    ``fold_in(k, "1")`` are different keys, and no sequence of integer folds
    can reach a key derived through a string fold.  That separation is what
    makes the domain convention work, so the two kinds are used for different
    jobs:

    - **Integers are the caller's.** Steps, ranks, epochs, leaf and group
      indices, and every key :func:`split` hands back are integer folds of a
      key you already hold.
    - **Strings root a mechanism.** A mechanism that draws randomness folds one
      unique string tag into the key it was given, once, and derives everything
      else beneath that tag.

    Skipping the string root is the failure this convention exists to prevent:
    ``fold_in(key, step)`` is the derivation *every* mechanism writes, so two
    mechanisms handed the same base key draw byte-identical noise, and nothing
    — not a test, an error, or an accountant — reports it.  See
    ``docs/reference/rng.md`` for the convention and the tags Opaque's own
    mechanisms already occupy.

    Args:
        rng_key: Base key.
        *data: One or more int or str values to fold in sequentially.

    Returns:
        A new RngKey derived from the base key and all folded values.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If ``rng_key`` is not an :class:`RngKey` or any value is not
            an int (excluding ``bool``) or str.
        ValueError: If no data values are provided.

    Example:
        >>> k = key(42)
        >>> stream = fold_in(k, "mylab.rare_events")  # root your mechanism
        >>> fold_in(stream, step)                     # then step, rank, leaf...
        >>> fold_in(stream, step, rank)               # equals fold_in twice
