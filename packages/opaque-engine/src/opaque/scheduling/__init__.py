"""Step-indexed schedules + warmup / restart / WSD composition.

Each schedule is a frozen, callable recipe dataclass; the factory
functions construct the matching recipe.  Call-site usage is unchanged
from the previous closure-based API::

    from opaque.scheduling import cosine_schedule, with_warmup

    decay = cosine_schedule(
        init_value=1e-3, end_value=0.0,
        transition_steps=900, transition_begin=100,
    )
    schedule = with_warmup(decay, transition_steps=100)
    schedule(step)   # → float, scheduled value at integer step

The recipe classes themselves live in :mod:`opaque.scheduling.types`
for ``isinstance`` checks and type annotations — matching how
:mod:`opaque.dpftrl.noise.types` exposes its strategy classes.
