    """Drive one federated round per call, returning its clipped gradient.

    The federated twin of ``opaque.dpsgd.clipping.clipped_grad``: the batch
    axis is a cohort of clients and IFED executes each round. ``session``
    already fixes the population, the cardinality and the assignment
    separation, and ``strategy`` — a
    :func:`~opaque.api.federated.clipping.clipped_sum` — fixes the per-client
    clipping threshold, so this call only threads parameters in and gradients
    out::

        strategy = fed.clipped_sum(clipping_norm=1.0)
        plan = ifed.build_train(net=net, source=Iris, loss=ifed.Loss.mse,
                                batch_size=None, strategy=strategy)
        with ifed.session(plan, store, assign_delta=sampler.assign_delta) as run:
            params = plan.init(plan.input_dir).params
            grad_fn, clip_state = fed.clipped_grad(run, strategy)
            for cohort in loader:
                grads, clip_state = grad_fn(params, cohort, state=clip_state)

    ``grads`` is a ``ClippedPytree`` with ``max_norm = clipping_norm /
    normalize_by``, so the noise → optimizer → accountant chain downstream is
    the central DP-SGD one unchanged.

    Args:
        session: An open ``ifed.session(...)`` over a plan built with
            ``strategy``.
        strategy: The :func:`clipped_sum` strategy that plan was built with;
            its ``clipping_norm`` is the sensitivity the result advertises.
        normalize_by: Gradient normalization constant. Defaults to the cohort
            size, giving averaged gradients of sensitivity ``C / k``.
        timeout: Seconds one round may take, for a remote session that
            supports it. Reaching it cancels the round.

    Returns:
        ``(grad_fn, clip_state)`` where ``grad_fn(params, cohort, *, state)``
        returns ``(ClippedPytree, state)``, and ``clip_state`` is the same
        fieldless :class:`FixedClipState` marker central ``clipped_grad``
        threads.
