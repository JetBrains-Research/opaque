"""SimPO: simple, reference-free, length-normalized preference loss with a margin.

SimPO (Meng et al., "SimPO: Simple Preference Optimization with a
Reference-Free Reward", 2024) drops the reference model and scores each response
by its **length-normalized** average log-probability, with a target reward
margin ``gamma``::

    L = -log σ(β·(r_w - r_r) - γ),   r = (1/|y|) · log π(y)

It reduces to the length-normalized DPO sigmoid loss at ``gamma=0``. The
length-normalization and reference-free reward are the caller's responsibility:
pass log-ratios already divided by each completion's token count (use
``sequence_logp(..., length_normalized=True)``) and, being reference-free,
formed from the policy log-prob alone (no reference subtraction).
