LD-DPO observes that vanilla DPO is biased by completion length: longer
completions accumulate more (signed) log-prob mass, which entangles a verbose
bias into the preference signal. LD-DPO splits each completion's logp at the
"public length" (the shorter completion length): the public portion has weight
``1.0`` and the length-desensitised tail is weighted by ``alpha`` in ``[0, 1]``.
Setting ``alpha < 1`` damps the tail's
contribution, desensitising the objective to completion length::

    pos    = completion_mask.cumsum(-1)
    weight = where((pos >= 1) & (pos <= shared_prefix_len), 1.0, alpha)
    logp   = (per_token_logps * completion_mask * weight).sum(-1)

At ``alpha = 1`` this reduces to the plain masked-sum sequence logp; at
``alpha = 0`` only tokens within the public length contribute.

Positions are completion-relative: prompt and padding positions remain zero,
while completion tokens are numbered ``1, 2, ...``. ``shared_prefix_len`` is a
compatibility name for the paper's public length, not a token-identical prefix.
It may be a Python ``int`` or a per-example tensor; it is broadcast against the
position axis, so a per-example tensor of shape ``(..., 1)`` selects a different
public length per example.

    Weights completion tokens within the public length by ``1.0`` and tokens

    Args:
        per_token_logps: Per-token log-probabilities of the completion. Shape
            ``(..., T)``; leading dims may be empty (per-example under
            ``vmap``) or a batch axis.
        completion_mask: Tensor of shape ``(..., T)``; non-zero where a token
            belongs to the completion span. Cast to the logp dtype.
        shared_prefix_len: The paper's public length (the shorter completion
            length), retained under this compatibility name. A Python ``int``
            (same value for every example) or a per-example tensor that
            broadcasts against the position axis ``(T,)`` (e.g. shape
            ``(..., 1)``). The first ``shared_prefix_len`` completion tokens are
            weighted ``1.0``; later completion tokens are weighted ``alpha``.
        alpha: Weight on the length-desensitised tail in ``[0, 1]``.
            ``alpha = 1`` recovers the plain masked-sum; ``alpha = 0`` keeps
            only tokens within the public length.

    Returns:
        Float tensor of shape ``(...)`` (one length-desensitised logp per
        sequence).

    Note:
        This low-level, single-sequence primitive cannot derive the public
        length from a chosen/rejected pair. Callers claiming the LD-DPO
        objective must pass the minimum of the paired completion lengths.
