"""DFT (Dynamic Fine-Tuning) per-example loss.

Implements the DFT loss from:

    Yang et al., "Dynamic Fine-Tuning: Token-Level Importance-Aware SFT",
    arXiv:2508.05629 (2025).

The per-token loss is the standard NLL weighted by the **stop-gradient**
(detached) softmax probability of the target token:

    p  = softmax(logits, dim=-1).gather(target).detach()   # stop-gradient
    logp = selective_log_softmax(logits, target)           # differentiable
    per_token_loss = -p * logp

The detach on ``p`` is essential: it means the gradient flows only through
``logp``, not through ``p``.  If ``p`` were not detached the gradient of the
weighted term ``-p·logp`` w.r.t. the logits would include a second term
from the derivative of ``p``, changing the loss landscape and breaking
numeric parity with the TRL reference implementation.

**DP-corrected divisor (plan §3.3 pre-clip rule, §8.2).**
TRL's ``SFTTrainer`` divides by a *batch-level* ``num_items_in_batch`` (the
total number of non-ignored tokens across the entire batch).  This is a
cross-example aggregate and is **not DP-safe** as a pre-clip divisor: its
value changes when any example in the batch changes, coupling per-example
gradients.  This implementation instead divides by this example's own
non-ignored token count — ``mask.sum(-1).clamp(min=1)`` — computed
**before** gradient clipping.  This matches the Tier-1 per-example
pre-clip divisor rule.

``clamp(min=1)`` on the divisor guards the all-ignored-token edge case.

**DP-purity: Tier 1** (plan §3.3).  Output depends only on this example's
data.  Verified by NaN-injection contract (plan §11.3).

**Vmap-safety** (plan §3.4): pure tensor operations; no Python control flow
on tensor values; no ``.item()``; no module state.

def dft_loss(

    """Per-example DFT loss with detached softmax weighting and DP-safe divisor.

    Shifts ``logits[..., :-1, :]`` against ``labels[..., 1:]``, computes
    the per-token DFT loss ``-detach(softmax_prob) * logp``, masks positions
    where the shifted label is ``-100``, and returns the **per-example mean**
    over non-ignored tokens using a per-example divisor (DP-safe, plan §8.2).

    The weighting probability ``p`` is detached (stop-gradient), so the
    gradient of the loss w.r.t. ``logits`` equals that of ``-p.detach() *
    logp``.  This matches the TRL ``dft`` formula in spirit but uses the
    DP-corrected per-example divisor instead of TRL's batch-level
    ``num_items_in_batch``.

    Args:
        logits: Float tensor of shape ``(..., T, V)`` where ``T`` is the
            sequence length and ``V`` is the vocabulary size.
        labels: Integer tensor of shape ``(..., T)``.  Values of ``-100``
            are ignored (set by the collator for prompt / pad tokens).

    Returns:
        Float tensor of shape ``(...)`` (0-dim for a single example, ``(B,)``
        for a batch).  Each entry is
        ``(per_token_loss * mask).sum(-1) / mask.sum(-1).clamp(min=1)``.
