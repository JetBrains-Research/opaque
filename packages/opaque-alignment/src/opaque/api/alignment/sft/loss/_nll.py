"""Standard causal-LM NLL (cross-entropy) loss.

Implements the per-example negative log-likelihood loss used in supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) for causal language models.  The shifted-labels
convention matches that of HuggingFace ``transformers`` and TRL:

    shifted_logits = logits[..., :-1, :]
    shifted_labels = labels[..., 1:]

Tokens with ``shifted_labels == -100`` (the ignore index) are excluded from
the per-example mean, as in ``torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=-100)``.

 The per-example divisor is this
example's own non-ignored token count — a quantity derived purely from this
example's data.  This guarantees that swapping one example's data changes
only that example's gradient, satisfying the per-record sensitivity bound
required by DP-SGD / DP-FTRL.  Unlike TRL's ``SFTTrainer``, which divides
by a *batch-level* ``num_items_in_batch``, this function performs **pre-clip
division** by the per-example token count, consistent with the DP-safe
divisor rule in plan §3.3 and §8.2.

``clamp(min=1)`` on the divisor guards the all-ignored-token edge case
(prevents division-by-zero and produces 0.0 for an all-masked row).

**Vmap-safety**: pure tensor operations; no Python control flow
on tensor values; no ``.item()``; no module state.  Works for batched
inputs ``(B, T, V)`` / ``(B, T)`` and per-example inputs ``(T, V)`` /
``(T,)`` under ``torch.func.vmap(torch.func.grad(...))``.

    """Per-example causal-LM NLL loss with per-example DP-safe divisor.

    Shifts ``logits[..., :-1, :]`` against ``labels[..., 1:]`` (standard
    causal-LM convention), masks positions where the shifted label is
    ``-100``, computes ``selective_log_softmax`` at the (clamped) shifted
    labels, and returns the **per-example mean** of the negative per-token
    log-probabilities over non-ignored tokens.

    The divisor ``mask.sum(-1).clamp(min=1)`` is computed per example from
    this example's data only.

    Args:
        logits: Float tensor of shape ``(..., T, V)`` where ``T`` is the
            sequence length and ``V`` is the vocabulary size.  Leading dims
            ``(...)`` may be absent (per-example) or a batch axis ``(B,)``.

            dims of ``logits``.  Values of ``-100`` are ignored.
