"""SFT collator impl — the language-modeling collator factory.

``language_modeling_collator`` is a factory returning a stateless collate
callable, following the repo convention that public builders prefer factory
functions over user-instantiated classes. Its output schema (:class:`LMBatch`) lives in
:mod:`opaque.api.alignment.sft.collator.types`.
