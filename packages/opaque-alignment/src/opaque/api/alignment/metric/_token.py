"""Token-level telemetry: prediction entropy and next-token accuracy.

Both functions are masked diagnostics computed during training. They are
private internal state, so every returned tensor is detached and never carries
gradient back into the mechanism. Masked reductions guard against
divide-by-zero on an all-masked batch via ``mask.sum().clamp(min=1)``.
