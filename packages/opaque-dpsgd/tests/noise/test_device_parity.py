"""Cross-device parity for DP-SGD Gaussian noise (privacy correctness).

The privacy guarantee on Apple Silicon (MPS) and CUDA rests on the noise being
drawn from the *same* key-determined random stream regardless of device.
opaque samples the underlying uniforms on a CPU generator and moves them to the
compute device (see ``_gaussian._sample``: ``torch.rand(..., generator=cpu_gen)
.to(device)``), so the stream is device-independent; only the on-device
``erfinv`` / ``erf`` transform rounds differently between backends.

These tests lock that in: for a fixed key, CPU and accelerator noise must agree
to floating-point-rounding tolerance (proving the same draws), and a *different*
key must diverge by O(noise scale) (proving the tolerance isn't vacuous).  A
regression that made noise device-dependent — e.g. sampling uniforms on the
device with a device generator — would break these and flag a privacy bug, not
merely a performance one.  Track-B performance work (kernels / compile / dtype)
touches the model forward-backward only, never this noise path; these tests are
the guard that keeps that boundary honest.
