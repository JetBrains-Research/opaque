"""Disable dropout for DP-SGD training.

DP-SGD trains without dropout in practice (per-sample clipping + noise is the
regulariser), and dropout doesn't play well with the per-sample-gradient path:
PyTorch's default ``vmap`` mode rejects hidden random operations, while SDPA's
*fused* dropout is also incompatible with batched tensor inputs. This compat
patch traverses the model once and zeros every dropout source — the
``nn.Dropout`` modules and the float dropout-rate attributes that forwards read
directly (e.g. the ``dropout_p`` SDPA receives from
``self.attention_dropout``).
