"""Precision helpers for DPTrainer.

Eval-time full-cast: HF parity for ``bf16_full_eval=True`` casts the model
in place for the eval scope and restores it on exit.  This is distinct
from training-time precision, where ``bf16=True`` enables autocast (no
model cast) — see
:meth:`opaque.transformers.trainer.DPTrainer._setup_precision`.

    On entry, casts the model in place if ``args.bf16_full_eval`` is set
    *and* the model isn't already at the target dtype.  On exit, restores
    the model to ``train_dtype`` (captured at trainer ``__init__``).

        model: The model to cast.  Mutated in place (and restored on exit).

        train_dtype: The dtype the model should be in *outside* this
            context — captured by ``DPTrainer.__init__`` so nested calls
            and the no-op case behave correctly.

    Yields:
        Nothing.  The context manager is purely for the side effect.

    HF-parity note: HF's ``bf16_full_eval`` casts the model rather than
    using autocast (see ``transformers.trainer.py``), and we mirror that.
