"""Canary test: every upstream HF / TRL config field is bucketed exactly once.

This is the **drift catcher** for the opaque compat manifest. When upstream
HF or TRL ships a new ``TrainingArguments`` / ``SFTConfig`` / ``DPOConfig``
field on a release whose manifest opaque hasn't been updated for, the new
field will be unclassified by the bucket sets and this test fails.

The failure tells the maintainer:
1. Which new field appeared upstream.
2. To decide its bucket (DIRECT / RENAME / TRANSFORM / REJECT_IF_SET /
   DROP_WITH_WARN) and add it to the right constant in
   ``opaque.api.transformers.compat._hf`` (or ``_trl`` for the TRL surfaces
   once those land).

The test is the discipline that keeps the manifest in sync with upstream.
