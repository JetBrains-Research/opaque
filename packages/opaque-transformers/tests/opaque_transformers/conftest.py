"""Conftest for Transformers / DPTrainer integration tests.

Re-exports shared Qwen2 fixtures used by compatibility tests.

Applies the opaque-patches runtime patches once at collection time so the
vmap-safety patches are in effect for the whole test session. Patching is
opt-in in production; tests opt in via this conftest.
