"""Tests for the qwen3_5_moe family (MoE).

Shares the qwen3_moe / qwen3_next patch path. Its tiny config is too fragile to
construct in transformers 5.11 (many undefaulted hybrid fields), so the forward
suite is skipped; the patch wiring is exercised by the sibling MoE families and
the family-coverage guard.
