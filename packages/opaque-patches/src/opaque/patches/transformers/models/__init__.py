"""Built-in HuggingFace model family patches.

Importing this package eagerly imports every shipped model file.  Each
file ends with a ``register_family(...)`` call, so all built-in
families land in the registry by the time
:func:`opaque.patches.transformers.supported_families` is called.

The cost is bounded: each ``models/X.py`` only constructs two factory
closures and registers them — the actual ``transformers.models.X``
modeling module is imported lazily inside the apply function (when the
patch is first used on a real model), not at import time.
