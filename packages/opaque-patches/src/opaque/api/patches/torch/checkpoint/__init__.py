"""Enable non-reentrant gradient checkpointing under vmap(grad(...)).

``apply_checkpoint_patch`` installs only the patches the running PyTorch needs.
When torch supports the composition natively, only the HuggingFace glue is
applied; the torch-core patches are skipped (and several would be harmful, e.g.
stripping the now-scoped higher-order guard). Each patch lives in its own module
named for the surface it patches:

- ``saved_tensor_hooks_guard`` / ``save_on_cpu``  -- gated on the guard scoping
- ``noop_save_inputs``                            -- old-arch only (self-skips)
- ``create_graph`` / ``reparametrize_recompute``  -- gated on native support
- ``huggingface``                                 -- always (if transformers imports)

See :mod:`.native_support` for the capability probes.
