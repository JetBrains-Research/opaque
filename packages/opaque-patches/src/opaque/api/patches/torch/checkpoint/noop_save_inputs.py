"""Give checkpoint's ``_NoopSaveInputs`` bookkeeping autograd Function a vmap rule.

Non-reentrant checkpoint on torch < 2.12 saves its inputs through a no-op
``autograd.Function`` that lacks a batching rule, so vmap over a checkpointed
region errors. The rule is a pure no-op data-wise.

torch >= 2.12 (PR #174327) replaced this Function with a C++ saved-tensor path
that already works under vmap, so ``_NoopSaveInputs`` is gone; :func:`apply`
self-skips in that case.
